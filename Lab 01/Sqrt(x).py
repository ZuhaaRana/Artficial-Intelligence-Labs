#SQRT(x)

# Sqrt(x) without any built-in methods (10 Marks)
# Given a non-negative integer x, compute and return the square root of x.
# Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated, and only the integer part of the result is returned. 

# Example 1:
# Input: x = 4
# Output: 2

# Example 2:
# Input: x = 8
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842â€¦, and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
